## BEST MOVES FOR PUNISHING OPPONENT MISTAKES (Long Recovery)

### When Opponent Has Long Recovery:
1. **Use 5S1 (Rocket Grab)** - If they're in recovery and close to mid-screen
2. **Use 2S2 (Garbage Collection)** - If they're close range with extended recovery
3. **Use 5M or 5L chains** - Safe pressure to build meter while they recover
4. **Use jS1** - Jump in for combo if they're caught in combo stun

### Opponent-Specific Punishes:
- **After blocked Super by opponent** (-27f or worse frame disadvantage):
  - Chain 2L → 5L → 5M for safe pressure
  - 5S1 if they're at mid-screen (safe grab)
  - 2S2 if they're close (command grab mixup)

- **After blocked Rocket Punch by opponent** (typical -15f disadvantage):
  - Free confirmed combo opportunity
  - Use 2M or 2L to start combo chain
  - Set up 6S2 → 2S2 grab sequence

---

## ASSIST REQUIREMENTS QUICK REFERENCE

**ALWAYS USE ASSIST COVER FOR**:
- 5H (recover from -10f with assist extension)
- 4H (recover from -10f)
- 5S2 (recover from MASSIVE -15f)
- 6S2 (recover from -12f)
- Super 1 (-27f needs heavy assist cover)
- Super 2 (-54f++ needs MULTIPLE assists or just don't use raw)

**OPTIONAL ASSIST FOR**:
- 5M (if opponent has fast reflect/interrupt)
- 2M (gap closer, assist helps confirm)

**NO ASSIST NEEDED**:
- 5L, 2L, 3L, jL, jM, j2H (all safe)
- Throws (true on-hit grabs)
- Meter-building moves

---

## STEAM METER PRIORITY MOVES

**Build Steam With**:
1. 6S2 (Spinning Turbine) - Builds meter during extended animations
2. 2S2 (Garbage Collection) - Builds on successful grab connects
3. jS2 (Wrecking Ball) - Builds during multi-hit animation
4. Super 1 - Builds meter on hit/block

**Spend Steam For**:
- 5S1_steam (faster Rocket Grab - 20f vs 25f startup)
- Enhanced damage on empowered versions
- +10% movement speed buff

---

## QUICK PLAYSTYLE SUMMARY

### Neutral Game
- Use 5M as forward-moving gap closer
- 5S1 for mid-screen pressure (safe on block +4f)
- jS2 for aerial mixups and meter building

### Pressure/Blockstun
- 5L → 5M chains for safe pressure
- 2L → 2M for low mixups
- 2S2 for grab mixups on + frames

### Punishment
- 2M combo starter on most confirmed hits
- 6S2 → 2S2 for high damage
- Super 1/Ultimate for major damage when space allows

### Recovery Defense
- 4H as anti-air vs crossups
- 2H as anti-air launcher
