## STANDING NORMALS (Ground Moves)

### 5L - Standing Light Attack
Quick punch from a standing position. Fast startup (8 frames) makes it hard to react to.
| Move | Damage | Startup | Recovery | On Block | Notes | Strategy |
|------|--------|---------|----------|----------|-------|----------|
| **5L** | 45 | 8f | 12f | -2f | Standard light strike | Safe combo starter, use in pressure |
| **5M** | 65 | 11f | 18f | -5f | Forward advancing medium | Gap closer, chain into 5L/5M/5H |
| **5H** | 90 | 16f | 31f | -10f | Ground bounce on hit | ⚠️ RISKY ON BLOCK - only use with assist cover |
| **5H (Charged)** | 110 | 28f | 31f | -9f | Dash-cancellable charged version | Can cancel recovery with dash; use with assist only |

**MOVE EXPLANATIONS**:
- **5L (Standing Light)**: Quick punch. Blitzcrank jabs forward. Fast and safe, good for starting combos.
- **5M (Standing Medium)**: Stronger punch that moves him forward. Good for closing distance on opponents.
- **5H (Standing Heavy)**: Powerful overhead punch. Hits HARD but risky if opponent blocks - takes 31 frames to recover. ⚠️ Only use when you're sure you'll hit or when an ally covers you.
- **5H Charged**: Hold the button to charge up the heavy attack. Becomes even stronger but takes longer to start (28 frames). Can cancel the recovery by doing a dash move.

## CROUCHING NORMALS (Low Moves)

### Low Attack Options - Hitting While Crouched
When Blitzcrank crouches down, he can throw attacks aimed at the opponent's legs/midsection.

| Move | Damage | Startup | Recovery | On Block | Notes | Strategy |
|------|--------|---------|----------|----------|-------|----------|
| **2L** | 45 | 9f | 12f | -3f | Fastest low | Safe pressure, excellent for mixups |
| **2M** | 50×2 | 11f | 20f | -5f | Multi-hit launcher, vacuum effect | Catches jump attempts, key combo starter |
| **2H** | 90 | 13f | 33f | -16f | Anti-air launcher with Air Tailspin CH | ⚠️ UNSAFE - use ONLY to counter airborne opponents |

**MOVE EXPLANATIONS**:
- **2L (Crouching Light Kick)**: Fast low kick at opponent's legs while crouched. Very quick to start (9 frames). Good for keeping pressure going.
- **2M (Crouching Medium Punch)**: Two-hit spinning punch while crouched. Hits multiple times and pulls opponent toward you (vacuum effect). Catches opponents trying to jump away.
- **2H (Crouching Heavy Kick)**: Upward boot kick while crouching. Hits airborne opponents hard and launches them. On Counter Hit (hitting them during their attack), creates a "Tailspin" effect for extended combos. ⚠️ Don't use unless opponent is jumping at you - it's too slow otherwise and you'll get punished.

## JUMPING NORMALS (Air Moves)

### Air Attacks - What Blitzcrank Does While Airborne
When Blitzcrank jumps, he can throw attacks from the air. These are especially good for overhead attacks or mixing up opponents.

| Move | Damage | Startup | Recovery | On Block | Notes | Strategy |
|------|--------|---------|----------|----------|-------|----------|
| **jL** | 45 | 7f | 17f | -15f | Air crossup attempt | Good for jump-in combos |
| **jM** | 65 | 9f | 24f | -15f | Good combo filler mid-air | Mix with jL for crossups |
| **jH** | 90 | 14f | 23f | -5f | Can be charged for wall bounce | Safe on block vs grounded opponent |
| **j2H** | 90 | 17f | 18f | -2f | Crossup belly flop | Best jump crossup option, safe recovery |

**MOVE EXPLANATIONS**:
- **jL (Air Light Kick)**: Quick air kick while jumping. Can fool opponents by switching which side you land on (crossup attempt).
- **jM (Air Medium Punch)**: Mid-strength punch while in the air. Good for extending combos mid-air or as part of jump mixups.
- **jH (Air Heavy Punch)**: Strong overhead punch from the air. Can be charged (hold button) to bounce opponent off walls. Safe when blocked by a standing opponent, giving you good pressure.
- **j2H (Air Diving Belly Flop)**: Blitzcrank dives downward with his body. Can crossup opponents (hit from behind their guard). One of the safest air attacks on block.

## UNIQUE MOVES (Command Normals)

### Special Attack Inputs - Medium + Heavy Combinations
These require specific button combinations instead of just directions.

| Move | Damage | Startup | Recovery | On Block | Notes | Strategy |
|------|--------|---------|----------|----------|-------|----------|
| **3L** | 50 | 9f | 12f | -1f | Mid-range low strike | Safe, no self-chain |
| **66H** | 90 | 18f | 29f | -9f | Running strike, hits OTG | Follow-up on knockdowns, low-crush |
| **4H** | 90 | 15f | 28f | -10f | Vertical launcher, anti-crossup | Use vs air opponents; ⚠️ unsafe on block |

**MOVE EXPLANATIONS**:
- **3L (Diagonal Low Kick)**: Blitzcrank kicks at a diagonal angle toward the ground. Good mid-range poke that's safe on block.
- **66H (Forward Dash Heavy Punch)**: Run forward while throwing a heavy punch. Hits low-to-the-ground targets (OTG = "On The Ground" - hits fallen opponents). Good for following up after knocking someone down.
- **4H (Backward Heavy - Vertical Launcher)**: Upward punch thrown backward. Launches opponents into the air, good against jump-ins. ⚠️ Risky if blocked - opponent gets turn advantage.

---

## THROWS (Command Grabs)

### Grab Attacks - Unblockable Grappling Moves
These grab the opponent directly and cannot be blocked. They deal massive damage and always result in knockdown.

| Move | Damage | Startup | Recovery | Notes | Strategy |
|------|--------|---------|----------|-------|----------|
| **5MH** | 190 | 6f | 36f | Forward throw, hard knockdown | Use after pressure ends, respects teching |
| **4MH** | 210 | 6f | 36f | Back throw, ground bounce | Sets up OTG combos with 66H |
| **jMH** | 210 | 4f | Landing | Air throw (use 4MH for backwards) | Air-to-air option, mix with jump attacks |

**MOVE EXPLANATIONS**:
- **5MH (Forward Throw)**: Blitzcrank grabs the opponent and punches them forward with a steam burst. Knocks them down hard so they can't immediately recover. High damage (190) for a throw.
- **4MH (Back Throw)**: Grabs opponent and throws them backward while bouncing them off the ground. Lets you follow up with running attacks (66H) for extra damage.
- **jMH (Air Throw)**: Throw the opponent while both of you are in the air. Use 4 (backward) to throw behind you. Fastest throw startup (4 frames) because you're already airborne. Forces aerial opponent into knockdown.

## SPECIAL MOVES - ROCKET GRAB LINE (5S1)

### Blitzcrank's Signature Grappling Hook - His Main Tool

Blitzcrank fires a giant mechanical claw on a chain across the screen. If it connects, it pulls the opponent toward him.

### Rocket Grab (5S1) - Basic Version
**What it does**: Throws his iconic grabbing hook full-screen. If it connects with the opponent, it pulls them toward Blitzcrank no matter what - blocks don't stop this grab.

| Property | Value | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **Damage** | 1 | Grab move (resets combo count) |
| **Startup** | 25f | Slow but full-screen range |
| **Active** | 23f | Wide window to connect |
| **Recovery** | 30f | Moderate recovery |
| **On Block** | +4f | Slight advantage if blocked |
| **Range** | Fullscreen | Signature move |
| **Properties** | Can be punished if whiffed | ⚠️ HIGH RISK - use spacing carefully |

**STRATEGY**:
- ✅ **USE WITH ASSIST**: Cover whiff vulnerability with assist
- ✅ **Predict Jump**: Catch opponents trying to jump away
- ❌ **Risky at close range**: If opponent tech rolls behind you = free punish
- ✅ **Best at mid-screen**: Optimal spacing for safety

### Rocket Grab Empowered (5S1_steam) - Steam-Powered Version
**What it does**: When Blitzcrank has charged his Steam meter, the grab becomes faster and multi-hit, leaving opponent in "Shock State" (they take extra hitstun). Can break through projectiles.

| Property | Value | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **Damage** | 121 | Multi-hit with shock state |
| **Startup** | 20f | 5 frames FASTER than normal grab |
| **Recovery** | 44f | Longer recovery, but safer on hit |
| **Special Effect** | Shock State + Projectile Destruction | Can break through full-screen zoning |

**WHEN TO USE**: When steam bar is full - faster startup makes it safer. Good against zoning opponents.

### Power Fist Follow-up (5S1S1) - Uppercut After Grab
**What it does**: After successfully landing Rocket Grab, press S1 again for an uppercut that hits grabbed opponent. Part of the grab combo.

| Property | Value |

| **Startup** | 20f | Anti-air grab range |
| **Recovery** | 43f | Moderate recovery |
| **On Block** | +5f | Slight advantage |
| **Usage** | Airborne opponents only | Will whiff on grounded targets |

**STRATEGY**:
- ✅ **Use vs Jump Attacks**: Catches all air normals before they connect
- ✅ **Use with assist**: Cover recovery if whiffed
- ❌ **No mixup tool**: Only works against airborne foes - don't throw this at standing opponents!

### Waste Disposal Follow-up (2S1S1) - Ground Bounce After Grab
**What it does**: After Air Purifier connects, press S1 again to throw opponent down. They bounce off the ground, opening follow-up attacks.

| Property | Value |

| **Damage** | 120 | Strike-type move |
| **Startup** | 21f | Slow startup |
| **Active** | 13f | Long active frames |
| **Recovery** | 25f | Moderate recovery |
| **On Block** | -15f | ⚠️ VERY UNSAFE - avoid unless with assist |
| **Special** | Can destroy projectiles + wall bounce airborne targets | Zoning tool |

**STRATEGY**:
- ✅ **USE WITH ASSIST**: Massive recovery means assist cover is essential
- ✅ **Anti-zoning**: Destroys full-screen projectile patterns (stops zoner characters)

**FOLLOW-UP**: Can chain into Prompt Disposal (6S2 → 2S2 grab)

### Prompt Disposal Follow-up (6S2_2S2) - Command Grab After Spin
**What it does**: After Spinning Turbine connects, immediately press down+S2 to throw opponent. They stay in the forward momentum from the spin, so the grab catches them even if they're trying to escape backward.

| Property | Value | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **Damage** | 250 | Command grab |
| **Startup** | 6f | Quick after Spinning Turbine |
| **Recovery** | 58f | Long but worth it on hit (combo) |

## RECOVERY SUMMARY & UNSAFE MOVES

### VERY UNSAFE ON BLOCK (-10f or worse)
⚠️ **MUST USE WITH ASSIST COVER**:
- **5H** (-10f) - charged version slightly safer at -9f
- **4H** (-10f) - anti-air launcher
- **5S2/Rocket Punch** (-15f) - EXTREMELY UNSAFE
- **6S2/Spinning Turbine** (-12f)
- **2H** (-16f) - anti-air, only use vs airborne
- **Super 1** (-27f) - never raw
- **Super 2** (-54f to -59f) - only in confirmed combos

### SAFE MOVES (0f or advantage on block)
✅ **Can use without assist cover**:
- **5L** (-2f) - safe pressure
- **2L** (-3f) - safe low
- **3L** (-1f) - neutral on block
- **5M** (-5f) - tight but usable
- **2M** (-5f) - safe

- **jS1/Air Rocket Grab** (0f to +10f) - neutral to advantage

---

## BEST MOVES FOR PUNISHING OPPONENT MISTAKES (Long Recovery)

### When Opponent Has Long Recovery:
1. **Use 5S1 (Rocket Grab)** - If they're in recovery and close to mid-screen
2. **Use 2S2 (Garbage Collection)** - If they're close range with extended recovery
3. **Use 5M or 5L chains** - Safe pressure to build meter while they recover
4. **Use jS1** - Jump in for combo if they're caught in combo stun

### Opponent-Specific Punishes:
- **After blocked Super by opponent** (-27f or worse frame disadvantage):
  - Chain 2L → 5L → 5M for safe pressure
  - 5S1 if they're at mid-screen (safe grab)
  - 2S2 if they're close (command grab mixup)

- **After blocked Rocket Punch by opponent** (typical -15f disadvantage):
  - Free confirmed combo opportunity
  - Use 2M or 2L to start combo chain
  - Set up 6S2 → 2S2 grab sequence

---

## ASSIST REQUIREMENTS QUICK REFERENCE

**ALWAYS USE ASSIST COVER FOR**:
- 5H (recover from -10f with assist extension)
- 4H (recover from -10f)
- 5S2 (recover from MASSIVE -15f)
- 6S2 (recover from -12f)
- Super 1 (-27f needs heavy assist cover)
- Super 2 (-54f++ needs MULTIPLE assists or just don't use raw)

**OPTIONAL ASSIST FOR**:
- 5M (if opponent has fast reflect/interrupt)
- 2M (gap closer, assist helps confirm)

**NO ASSIST NEEDED**:
- 5L, 2L, 3L, jL, jM, j2H (all safe)
- Throws (true on-hit grabs)
- Meter-building moves

---

## STEAM METER PRIORITY MOVES

**Build Steam With**:
1. 6S2 (Spinning Turbine) - Builds meter during extended animations
2. 2S2 (Garbage Collection) - Builds on successful grab connects
3. jS2 (Wrecking Ball) - Builds during multi-hit animation
4. Super 1 - Builds meter on hit/block

**Spend Steam For**:
- 5S1_steam (faster Rocket Grab - 20f vs 25f startup)
- Enhanced damage on empowered versions
- +10% movement speed buff

---

## QUICK PLAYSTYLE SUMMARY

### Neutral Game
- Use 5M as forward-moving gap closer
- 5S1 for mid-screen pressure (safe on block +4f)
- jS2 for aerial mixups and meter building

### Pressure/Blockstun
- 5L → 5M chains for safe pressure
- 2L → 2M for low mixups
- 2S2 for grab mixups on + frames

### Punishment
- 2M combo starter on most confirmed hits
- 6S2 → 2S2 for high damage
- Super 1/Ultimate for major damage when space allows

### Recovery Defense
- 4H as anti-air vs crossups
- 2H as anti-air launcher

## PLAYER COMBO STATISTICS - Match Analysis

### Understanding Combo Length
Combo length = number of individual moves hitting in one sequence without opponent escaping. Longer combos = better damage output and momentum control.

### Sample Match: Player 1 vs Player 2 (Blitzcrank vs Blitzcrank - Juggernaut Mode)

#### Round-by-Round Longest Combos

| Round | Player 1 Longest | Player 2 Longest | Situation |
|-------|------------------|------------------|-----------|
| Round 1 | 2M → 5L → 5M → 5H (4-hit) | 5L → 5M (2-hit) | Player 1 controls neutral better |
| Round 2 | 6S2 → 2S2 → Landing hit (3-hit grab) | 2L → 5M → 5H (3-hit) | Grab attempts from both |
| Round 3 | 5S1 → 5S1S1 → jM (3-hit grab combo) | 5M → 2H (2-hit) | Player 1 lands fullscreen grab |
| Round 4 | 2M → 5L → 5M → 2S2 → Throw (4-hit combo) | jS2×3 → Landing (3-hit air combo) | Extended pressure vs jump defense |
| Round 5 | 4MH → 66H → 5L → 5M (4-hit throw combo) | 5H → jL → jM (3-hit) | OTG follow-up vs air escape |

**Key Observations**:
- ✅ Player 1 consistently lands 4+ hit combos (better conversion rate)
- ⚠️ Player 2 mostly 2-3 hit combos (missing follow-ups)
- 🎯 Grab combos provide longest damage output (3-5 hits average)
- 📊 Average Player 1: 3.6 hits per combo | Player 2: 2.6 hits per combo

#### Damage Per Combo Type

| Combo Type | Avg Length | Avg Damage | Best Player | Notes |
|------------|-----------|-----------|------------|-------|
| **Light Chain** (5L×n) | 2-3 hits | 80-120 | Both | Safe but low reward |
| **Mid Pressure** (5M×n) | 3-4 hits | 150-220 | Player 1 | Bread & butter |
| **Grab Combo** (5S1/2S2) | 3-5 hits | 250-450 | Player 1 | Highest reward, harder to execute |
| **Anti-Air** (2H → air) | 3-4 hits | 200-300 | Player 1 | Good knockdown follow-ups |
| **Throw Follow-up** (4MH → 66H) | 4-5 hits | 300-400 | Player 1 | Strong OTG extension |

---

#### Most Effective Combo Starters

| Starter | Times Used | Success Rate | Avg Damage | Best For |
|---------|-----------|-------------|-----------|----|
| **2M** | 6 | 100% | 180 | General pressure |
| **5S1** | 3 | 100% | 380 | Full-screen pickups |
| **2H** | 2 | 100% | 240 | Anti-air conversions |
| **5L** | 5 | 80% | 110 | Low commitment starts |
| **6S2** | 1 | 100% | 350 | Mid-range risk/reward |

**Player 1 Strategy**: Uses 2M as primary combo starter (safest, most reliable)
**Player 2 Issue**: Relies too much on 5L chains, doesn't confirm into bigger conversions

---

#### Missed Combo Opportunities

| Situation | Player 1 Missed | Player 2 Missed | Lesson |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|--------|
| After 2M hit | 0 | 3 | Always confirm 2M into combo |
| After throw knockdown | 1 | 4 | Practice 66H OTG follow-ups |
| After 2H anti-air | 0 | 2 | Always link into air combo from 2H CH |
| Assist setup situation | 0 | 1 | Call assist DURING combos for extensions |

## IMPROVING YOUR COMBO GAME

### Step 1: Confirm Your Hits
❌ **Wrong**: Throw out random combos
✅ **Right**: Wait to see opponent gets hit, THEN continue combo

### Step 2: Build Consistency
- Practice Combo 1-3 (BnB) 50+ times until muscle memory
- Record yourself and watch for where you drop combos
- Focus on hit-confirm points (2M into 5L is easiest)

### Step 3: Learn Situational Combos
- **Corner**: Switch to throw-based combos (4MH → OTG)
- **Mid-screen**: Use grab combos (5S1 → air follow-up)
- **Air**: Use jS2 × 3 swing combos for crossup mixing

### Step 4: Optimize Damage
- Don't just extend combos - extend them with HIGH DAMAGE moves
- Example: 2M → 5L → 5H is better than 2M → 5L → 5M → 5L (shorter but BIGGER damage per move)
- Use Super moves (Super 1 damage 260) at end of long combos for finishers

### Step 5: Practice with Assist
- Most competitive players extend combos WITH their partner
- Assist call mid-combo extends hitstun and combo time
- Learn to "pilot" your partner's assist into your combo
